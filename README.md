My name is Trent Anderson. I am owner  of Sovereign Energy Solutions. I have designed a device that charges an internal battery for recharging external batteries in devices like cellphones. It requires no external power source nor any wind nor any light source. It can charge a 3000 milli-amp battery in less than an hour.
